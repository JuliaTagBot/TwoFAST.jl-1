2-FAST
======

The 2-FAST (*2-point function from Fast and Accurate Spherical bessel
Transform*) algorithm is implemented here in the [Julia](https://julialang.org)
programming language.

The algorithm is documented in the paper [Fast and Accurate Computation of
Projected Two-point functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02401).

Minimal examples are given in the file `Julia/twofast_example.jl`.
